# Invese Policy Mirror Descent

This is a repository for the paper Inverse Reinforcement Learning with the Average Reward Criterion.

The file `apmd.py` contains implementation for the Stochastic Policy Mirror Descent algorithm for solving AMDPs.

The file `iapmd.py` contains implementation for the Inverse Policy Mirror Descent algorithm for solving IRL with the average-reward criterion.
